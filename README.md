# OBS File Scrolling Text

### This is a simple marquee text scroll designed to be used in OBS.  

### Host  this file on a local web server (Can't load text files automatically from the file system)

### To use as a daily scroller, add text files for each day of the week. (monday.txt, tuesday.txt, etc)

### To use with a single file, call the url with ?file=filename

### The script checks for changes to the files every minute and flips the day at 12am machine time

### If your text is getting cut-off, add line breaks to your text (this is a bug in chrome and obs browser)
